00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
<v Leonato>I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon comes this night to Messina.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
<v Messenger>He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off when I left him.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
<v Leonato>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
<v Messenger>But few of any sort, and none of name.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
<v Leonato>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
<v Messenger>Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb, the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
<v Leonato>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
<v Messenger>I have already delivered him letters, and there appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.

<v Leonato>Did he break out into tears?

00:30.500 --> 00:32.500 align:left size:50%
<v Messenger>In great measure.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.500 align:right size:50%
<v Leonato>A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces truer than those that are so washed. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!

<v Beatrice><i>You know Iâ€™m so excited my glasses are falling off here.</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:38.000
<v Messenger>Is't possible?
