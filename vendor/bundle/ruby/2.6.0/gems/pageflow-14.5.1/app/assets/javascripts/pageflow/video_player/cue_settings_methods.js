   * Specify the display position of text tracks. This method can also
   * be used to make VideoJS reposition the text tracks after the
   * margins of the text track display have been changed (e.g. to
   * translate text tracks when player controls are displayed).
   *
   * To force such an update, the passed string has to differ from the
   * previously passed string. You can append a dot and an arbitrary
   * string (e.g. `"auto.translated"`), to keep the current setting but
   * still force repositioning.
   *
   * On the other hand, it is possible to change the positioning but
   * have VideoJS apply the change only when the next cue is
   * displayed. This way we can prevent moving a cue that the user
   * might just be reading. Simply append the string `".lazy"`
   * (e.g. `"auto.lazy"`).
   *
   * @param {string} line
   *   Either `"top"` to move text tracks to the first line or
   *   `"auto"` to stick with automatic positioning, followed by a tag
   *   to either force or prevent immediate update.
